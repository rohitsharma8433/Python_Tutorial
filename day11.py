"""In Python, a set is a built-in data type that represents an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets are commonly used for tasks that involve checking for membership, eliminating duplicates, and performing set operations like union, intersection, and difference. You can create a set in Python using curly braces {} or by using the set() constructor"""
