# -------------------------------Operators  in python ------------------------------

# Arithmetic operators in Python are used to perform mathematical operations on numerical values. Here are the primary arithmetic operators in Python, along with explanations and examples: +,-,*,,/,%,,**,//,

# Addition +: Adds two operands.
# x = 5
# y = 3
# result = x + y  
# print(result)

# Subtraction -: Subtracts the right operand from the left operand.
# x = 10
# y = 4
# result = x - y  # result is 6
# print(result)

# Multiplication *: Multiplies two operands.
# x = 7
# y = 2
# result = x * y  # result is 14

# Division /: Divides the left operand by the right operand as a floating-point division.
# x = 8
# y = 2
# result = x / y  # result is 4.0

# Floor Division //: Divides the left operand by the right operand and rounds down to the
# x = 9
# y = 2
# result = x // y  # result is 4

# Modulus %: Returns the remainder when the left operand is divided by the right operand.

# x = 15
# y = 7
# result = x % y  # result is 1

# Exponentiation **: Raises the left operand to the power of the right operand.
# x = 2
# y = 3
# result = x ** y  # result is 8

"""
In Python, comparison operators are used to compare two values and return a Boolean (True or False) result. Here are the comparison operators in Python """

# Equal to (==): Checks if two values are equal.
# x=10
# y=20
#  it return false
# print(x==y)


# x=20
# y=20
# #  it return false
# print(x==y)

# Not equal to (!=): Checks if two values are not equal. 

# x=10
# y=20
# #  it return True
# print(x!=y)

# x=50
# y=50
# #  it return false
# print(x!=y)

# Greater than (>): Checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand.


# x=10
# y=20
# print(x>y)
#   it return false

# x=10
# y=20
# print(y>x)

# it return True


# Less than (<): Checks if the left operand is less than the right operand.
# x=10
# y=20
# print(x<y)
#   it return false

# x=10
# y=20
# print(y<x)


# Greater than or equal to (>=): Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right 

# x=20
# y=20
# print(y>=x)


# x=21
# y=20
# print(y>=x)


# Less than or equal to (<=): Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand

5 <= 10   # True
10 <= 5   # False



""" In Python, assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. Python provides several assignment operators to make assignments and perform operations on variables in a concise manner. Here are some of the assignment operators in Python:"""


# = (Equal Sign): The basic assignment operator assigns the value on the right-hand side to the variable on the left-hand side


num=10
# print(num)
# +=,-=,*=,/=

# num+=30
# num=num+30
# print(num)
